        <h2> About</h2>
        <p>The term "Asian American" is a pan-ethnic term capturing more than ten different ethnicities under the race category of "Asian." Although this term comes with a sense of solidarity, it also creates a "flattening" effect for those caught under the term and also causes harmful stereotypes to arise.
            <br>
            <br>
            This site explores the importance of disaggregated data in relation to the "Asian American" category on the census.

            <br>
            <br>


            All the data has been taken from Asian American's Advancing Justice's (AAJC) 2010 census project "Communities of Contrast."

        <p>For each category, you must rank (by dragging) the different sub-APA groups from lowest to highest (% or $) according to what you think is the right order for that socio-economic indicator. Once you have done so, check your answers to see how close you got to the actual ranking. </p>
